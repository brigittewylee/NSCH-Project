# NSCH Project: Repeated Cross-Sectional Study 

This project analyzes data collected by the National Survey of Childrenâ€™s Health (NSCH) to determine the association between friendship development (FD) and bullying victimization (BV) amoung youth aged 12-17 years of age diagnosed with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) within the United States. Association between FD and BV will be compared through the years 2018-2023 in order to determine the potential impacts of COVID-19 [i.e., pre(2018,2019), peak (2020,2021), and post-COVID (2022,2023)]. The association between FD and BV will be further examined after controlling for
potential confounding variables including baseline outcome status, age, sex, family income, and neurobehavioral disorder management (i.e.,
behavioural therapy, medication).
